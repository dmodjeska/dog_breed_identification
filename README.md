## Introduction

During the period March-April 2018, Kaggle held a competition called DonorsChoose.org Application Screening. The goal was to predict whether teachers' project proposals were accepted by DonorsChoose.org, a non-profit organization. A full description of this competition is below. 

For processing the data, feature engineering and word vectorization (using TF-IDF) were used. For modeling the data, feature selection and XGBoost generated reasonable predictions.

## Description of Competition (from Kaggle Site)

Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?

In this playground competition, you are provided a strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to practice fine-grained image categorization. How well you can tell your Norfolk Terriers from your Norwich Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number training images per class, you might find the problem more, err, ruff than you anticipated.
